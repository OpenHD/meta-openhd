meta-openhd
===========

This layer provides support for building [OpenHD](https://github.com/OpenHD/OpenHD), an open-source digital video transmission system, with the Yocto Project.

Dependencies
------------
* Compatible with the Yocto Project "scarthgap" release
* Depends on the core `poky` layer

Adding the layer to your build
------------------------------
Clone this repository into your Yocto build tree and register the layer:

    bitbake-layers add-layer meta-openhd

Building OpenHD
---------------
Once the layer is added, the OpenHD application can be built with:

    bitbake openhd

The `openhd_git.bb` recipe tracks the latest commits from the OpenHD GitHub repository. The layer sets `BB_SRCREV_POLICY = "latest"` and the recipe uses `SRCREV = "${AUTOREV}"`, ensuring the build system checks for new upstream revisions each time the recipe is executed.
